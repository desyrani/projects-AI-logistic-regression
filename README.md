**Overview**

This repository contains implementations of Logistic Regression applied to two distinct datasets: the House Price Dataset and the Social Network Ads Dataset. Logistic Regression is a popular statistical method used for binary classification, and in these implementations, we explore how this technique can be applied to predict outcomes such as house prices and social network ad responses.

**Files Included:**

- Logistic Regression in House Price Dataset: Implementation of Logistic Regression to predict house prices (categorizing based on price range).
- Logistic Regression in Social Network Ads Dataset: Application of Logistic Regression to classify user responses to social network advertisements.


**Key Features**

**1. Logistic Regression in House Price Dataset**

In this script, Logistic Regression is used to predict whether a house's price falls into a specific range (binary classification). The dataset consists of features such as location, size, and number of bedrooms, which are used to determine the price category.

**2. Logistic Regression in Social Network Ads Dataset**
   
This script applies Logistic Regression to classify whether a user will click on an ad based on features like age, estimated salary, and user demographics. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a user interacting with an advertisement on a social network platform.
